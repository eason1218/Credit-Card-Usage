Extract of the questions from @Gebru2021.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to analyze global financial inclusion across 139 countries, with a focus on understanding access to financial services, usage patterns, and barriers. It fills the gap of comprehensive, structured data on financial behaviors, services, and inclusion globally.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by the Development Research Group, Finance, and Private Sector Development Unit at the World Bank.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The dataset was funded by the World Bank, but no specific grant details are provided.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset is valuable for policymakers, financial institutions, and researchers, helping them track and improve global financial inclusivity.


**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances represent individual survey responses from people across 139 countries. These responses include data on financial behaviors, access to banking services, and financial literacy.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset contains 143,887 instances, with 128 variables representing a broad sample from various countries.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample of a larger set, focused on individuals from countries that participated in the survey. The sample is geographically representative across 139 countries.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- The data consists of survey responses, which include raw data such as age, income, access to bank accounts, mobile phone ownership, and derived features like financial literacy.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- There is no specific target variable. The dataset is used to explore financial inclusion outcomes, but no explicit label is attached.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Missing information may occur due to incomplete responses or countries not participating in certain aspects of the survey. These gaps may be due to regional differences in data availability.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships are made explicit through geographic and demographic linkages, allowing for analysis by country, income group, age group, and other demographic variables.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Specific data splits are not provided, but researchers might commonly split data by countries or income groups for validation and testing purposes.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Some noise may exist due to inconsistencies in data reporting across countries or demographic groups, as survey collection methods vary globally.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is self-contained. However, it may rely on national surveys or other data sources for specific countries. There is no guarantee of long-term availability of these external resources.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain confidential data. It includes aggregated survey data with no personally identifiable information.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain any such content. It focuses on financial behaviors and access to services.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- Yes, the dataset identifies sub-populations based on demographic factors such as age, gender, income, and country of residence. The dataset is distributed across various regions and income levels.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No, individuals cannot be identified directly or indirectly from the dataset as it is anonymized.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the dataset does not contain sensitive data such as race, health data, or criminal history, but it includes financial behaviors and access to financial services, which could be sensitive.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- The dataset is useful for large-scale analyses of financial inclusion and global financial behaviors but should be treated with care when drawing conclusions about specific individuals or groups

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data was acquired through direct survey responses from individuals across 139 countries. Data was self-reported and validated through the survey design and methodology.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- The data was collected via surveys conducted by national agencies and international survey teams, using standardized survey instruments across participating countries.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- The dataset uses probabilistic sampling to ensure that it is representative of the population in each country.
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
